"""Write a Python program to create a class called 'Complex'. Each Complex object should have real part and imaginary part. I
nclude method to find the magnitude and phase of the complex number.
 [ Hint 1 : Use round(x,4) function to limit the decimal values to 4 positions.]
 [ Hint 2 : Import math module and use math.atan2(imaginary_part,real_part) function to find the phase of the complex number.] 
 [ Hint 3 : Magnitude of a complex number is equal to square root of (real_part^2 + imaginary_part^2) ]
 Input Description : First line contains real part and imaginary part of the complex number separated by comma. 
 Sample input 2,3 Sample output 3.6056 0.9828"""
